1- What is the virtual DOM?

DOM stands for 'Document Object Model'. It is a structured representation of HTML in the webpage or application. It represents the entire UI(User Interface) of the web application as the tree data structure.

The concept of Virtual DOM comes to make the performance of Real DOM better and faster. Virtual DOM is a virtual symbol of the DOM.
But the main difference is that every time, with each change, the virtual DOM gets updated instead of the actual DOM.
For example, the real and virtual DOM is represented as a tree structure. Every element in the tree is a node. A node is added to the tree when a new item is added to the application UI.
If the position of any elements changes, a new virtual DOM tree is created. The virtual DOM computes the minimum number of operations on the real DOM to make changes to the real DOM. It is efficient and performs better by reducing the cost and operation of re-rendering the whole real DOM.
